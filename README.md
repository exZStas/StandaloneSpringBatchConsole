# Spring Batch admin console
Spring batch admin console is now available only as a part of 'DataFlow' project. No possibility to use it for standalone spring batch application.
So main idea of this project is to provide ability to get insight on the state of launched job.

Features like restart, launch jobs via admin console and analytics on finished jobs are planned for the future.

# Spring Batch admin console
Spring batch admin console is now available only as a part of 'DataFlow' project. No possibility to use it for standalone spring batch application.
So main idea of this project is to provide ability to explore history of spring batch jobs.

Features like restart and launch jobs via admin console are planned for the future.
